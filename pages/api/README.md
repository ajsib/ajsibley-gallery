Given the requirements you've outlined, let's structure the project by breaking down the database schema, API structure, and how we interact with Azure Blob Storage to achieve a scalable and maintainable solution.

### 1. **Database Schema Design**

Since you're using MongoDB (via Azure Cosmos DB), we'll design the schema to handle users, galleries, media (images/videos/files), and access control.

#### **Collections:**

1. **Users:**
   - Stores information about the users in the system.
   - **Fields:**
     - `_id`: Unique identifier (UUID).
     - `username`: String, unique.
     - `email`: String, unique.
     - `password_hash`: String, hashed password for authentication.
     - `createdAt`: Date, when the user was created.
     - `updatedAt`: Date, when the user information was last updated.

2. **Galleries:**
   - Stores information about each gallery.
   - **Fields:**
     - `_id`: Unique identifier (UUID).
     - `name`: String, the name of the gallery.
     - `ownerId`: UUID, references the user who created the gallery.
     - `accessCode`: String, a 5-digit code that allows other users to join the gallery.
     - `media`: Array of ObjectIDs, references to the `Media` collection.
     - `createdAt`: Date, when the gallery was created.
     - `updatedAt`: Date, when the gallery was last updated.

3. **Media:**
   - Stores information about each file (image, video, or other) uploaded to the gallery.
   - **Fields:**
     - `_id`: Unique identifier (UUID).
     - `fileUrl`: String, URL to the file in Azure Blob Storage.
     - `fileType`: String, type of file (e.g., image, video).
     - `uploadedBy`: UUID, references the user who uploaded the file.
     - `galleryId`: UUID, references the gallery the media belongs to.
     - `createdAt`: Date, when the media was uploaded.

4. **GalleryAccess:**
   - Manages access to galleries.
   - **Fields:**
     - `_id`: Unique identifier (UUID).
     - `galleryId`: UUID, references the gallery.
     - `userId`: UUID, references the user who has access.
     - `role`: String, role of the user (e.g., 'owner', 'viewer').
     - `createdAt`: Date, when the access was granted.

### 2. **API Structure**

We'll design API routes to interact with the database and Azure Blob Storage, ensuring the operations are optimized for uploading, managing, and securing media files.

#### **API Endpoints:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - **POST `/api/auth/register`**: Registers a new user.
   - **POST `/api/auth/login`**: Authenticates a user and returns a token.

2. **Gallery Management:**
   - **POST `/api/galleries`**: Creates a new gallery.
   - **GET `/api/galleries`**: Fetches all galleries the user has access to.
   - **GET `/api/galleries/:id`**: Fetches details of a specific gallery, including media.
   - **POST `/api/galleries/:id/join`**: Joins a gallery using an access code.

3. **Media Management:**
   - **POST `/api/galleries/:id/upload`**: Uploads multiple files to a gallery.
   - **DELETE `/api/media/:id`**: Deletes a specific media file.

4. **Access Control:**
   - **POST `/api/galleries/:id/invite`**: Invites another user to the gallery using an access code.

### 3. **Interacting with Azure Blob Storage**

We will use Azure Blob Storage for storing the actual media files (images, videos, etc.). Here’s how the interaction will work:

#### **File Upload Process:**
1. **Upload Many Files at Once:**
   - The user selects multiple files to upload.
   - The front-end application reads the files and sends them in a single request to the `/api/galleries/:id/upload` endpoint.
   - The API route handles the connection to Azure Blob Storage, uploads each file, and stores the file URLs in the `Media` collection in MongoDB.

2. **Storing File URLs:**
   - Each file uploaded to Azure Blob Storage returns a URL.
   - The URL is stored in the `Media` collection under the `fileUrl` field.

3. **Organizing Media into Galleries:**
   - Each media file is associated with a `galleryId`, which ties it to a specific gallery.
   - The `Galleries` collection references the `Media` collection via the `media` array.

### 4. **Scalability Considerations**

1. **Database Structure:**
   - The MongoDB schema is designed to be flexible and scalable. It allows for easy addition of new media types or access roles in the future.
   - Indexing can be applied to key fields like `userId`, `galleryId`, and `accessCode` to optimize queries as the data grows.

2. **API Design:**
   - The API routes are RESTful and can be expanded or versioned easily.
   - As traffic grows, you can implement caching strategies for frequently accessed resources (e.g., galleries and media lists).

3. **Azure Blob Storage:**
   - Blob Storage is highly scalable and will handle large volumes of file uploads seamlessly.
   - You can use Azure’s Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve media files quickly to users across the globe.

### 5. **Next Steps**

1. **Implement Database Schemas:**
   - If using Mongoose, define the schemas for Users, Galleries, Media, and GalleryAccess.
   - If not using Mongoose, structure your MongoDB queries to match the schema outlined.

2. **Build API Routes:**
   - Start by implementing the user authentication routes, then move on to gallery and media management.
   - Ensure you secure API routes that require authentication and validate user roles (e.g., only owners can invite others).

3. **Integrate Azure Blob Storage:**
   - Use the Azure SDK to handle file uploads, and link those files back to your MongoDB database.

4. **Develop Front-End Components:**
   - Create React components for uploading files, managing galleries, and viewing media.
   - Implement the access control UI to prompt users for access codes when needed.

5. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - Test the full workflow from uploading files to managing galleries and sharing access.
   - Optimize database queries and Azure Blob Storage interactions for performance.

By following this structure, your application will be both scalable and maintainable, with clear separation between the front-end, API, and storage layers. Let me know if you need more details or assistance with specific parts of the implementation!
